# HPC_Project
This project explores the implementation of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models using CUDA programming in Python. Instead of relying on high-level libraries, the core objective is to leverage low-level CUDA kernels to perform data preprocessing, training, and inference on the GPU.
